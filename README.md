# Launchgrade — Web Standards 2026

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Stack-agnostic starter template + technical baseline for modern web projects (2026 edition). Compliance-grade defaults for EU markets (BFSG / GDPR / TDDDG), Core Web Vitals, security headers, AI-crawler policy, and anti-slop design hygiene. Operationalized as three Claude Code skills.

> The standards documentation in `web-standards/` is intentionally in German — it cites German/EU legal frameworks (BFSG, DDG, TDDDG, MStV, ECJ rulings) where translation would lose legal precision. Tech terms (WCAG, CWV, CSP, JSON-LD) are English throughout, so most of the document is readable without German.

## What's inside

- **Launchgrade Web Standards 2026** (`web-standards/AGENTS.md` + `checklist.md`) — versioned baseline covering Performance (Core Web Vitals 2026), Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA + BFSG), SEO (classic + AI-crawler era), Security (CSP, headers, cookies, auth), Privacy (GDPR / TDDDG), Motion, PWA. RFC-2119 levels (MUST / Conditional MUST / SHOULD / MAY).
- **Three Claude Code skills** (`.claude/skills/`) — Foundation → Design → Audit:
  - `launchgrade-setup` — scaffolds required artifacts (robots.txt with AI-crawler defaults, security.txt, CSP, JSON-LD, favicon set, manifest, 404/500)
  - `launchgrade-design` — anti-slop design layer, DESIGN.md, named aesthetics, visual-diff loop
  - `launchgrade-audit` — pre-/post-launch via Lighthouse + Mozilla Observatory + PageSpeed Insights
- **Required files** in `public/` with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` tokens (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, llms.txt, security.txt, site.webmanifest, 404/500)
- **Claude Code settings** (`.claude/settings.json`) — permission allowlist for audit tooling, deny rules against force push and publish
- **Dev defaults**: `.gitignore`, `.nvmrc` (Node 20+)

## Usage

```bash
# Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/Everlast-Consulting-GmbH/launchgrade-web.git my-new-site
cd my-new-site
rm -rf .git && git init

# Dependencies (for local tooling, if any)
nvm use && npm install

# Audit CLIs (global, once)
npm install -g lighthouse @axe-core/cli
```

Then trigger `/launchgrade-setup` in Claude Code. The skill asks for stack, brand, domain, BFSG relevance, and fills the placeholders.

## Workflow

```
1. /launchgrade-setup    →  fill placeholders, scaffold stack, required files + configs (CSP, headers, JSON-LD)
2. /launchgrade-design   →  DESIGN.md, brand DNA, anti-slop
3. Build
4. /launchgrade-audit    →  pre-launch (Lighthouse + Observatory + PSI), findings as Blockers / Recommended / Nice-to-have
```

## Reading the standards directly

- **[`web-standards/AGENTS.md`](web-standards/AGENTS.md)** — full standards with §-structure and pass thresholds
- **[`web-standards/checklist.md`](web-standards/checklist.md)** — compact pre-launch checklist

These files are self-contained — you don't need the template or the skills to use them as a reference. Also usable as a contract appendix ("Conformance to Launchgrade Web Standards 2026").

## What's NOT in the template

- Framework-specific code (Next.js, Astro, SvelteKit) — the setup skill scaffolds the chosen stack
- DESIGN.md — per project via `launchgrade-design`
- Favicons as PNG/ICO — brand asset, per project
- CI/CD setup — intentionally omitted for solo / small-team repos
